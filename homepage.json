    "about_me": 
    "Currently, I am a full-stack software engineer at VMware working on Container Service Extension (CSE), a plugin for VMware Cloud Director(vCD) that allows cloud providers to offer Kubernetes-as-a-Service to tenants. My main responsibilities are building and testing features for CSE UI and backend services that manage cluster CRUD. I use Angular for the frontend and Golang for the backend.\\nAs a software engineer, I am most passionate about building useful and impactful products for users. I would say my main professional interest lies in fullstack software development, building out beautiful web UIs with functional UX and connecting them to services through robust APIs. However, I am eager to learn and experience other facets of software engineering. When I have the time, I stay sharp by working on hobby projects and solving minor inconveniences with modern development tools.\\nOutside of work, I enjoy going to the gym, playing volleyball and badminton, and hiking. In the winter, I am an avid skiier and snowboarder, and in other seasons, I am learning to surf üòÅ"
