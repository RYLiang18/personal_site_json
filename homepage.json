    "about_me": 
    "Presently, I am attending Zoom University from my home in sunny Orange County, California, working hard to graduate this Winter in three and a half years. Aside from school, I enjoy learning about interesting and cutting-edge technologies and building out fun projects with them.\\nSo far for my side projects, I have tampered the most with frontend and fullstack JavaScript, but there are many other technologies, computer science fields, and programming languages that I plan to get exposed to. In no particular order, these include Docker, automation, computer vision, fintech, blockchain, data science, Golang, and Arduino, just to name a few. Starting January 2021, I began occasionally live streaming my side projects on Twitch!\\nIn between my studies and side projects, I enjoy practicing gymnastics and HIIT, spending time with friends, and being outdoors! For the last year and a half, I have been active on Strava, logging in over 300 miles in hikes, runs, and workouts with my friends, and I hope to continue this trend through 2021 🏃🏻‍♂‍!"
