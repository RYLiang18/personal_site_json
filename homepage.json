    "about_me": 
    "Presently, I am interning for the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (yes, the one that took down Robinhood in early 2020) as a software engineer intern working on bringing up-to-date the company's archaic software! School-wise, I am working hard to graduate this Winter with my bachelor's (only 3 and a half years!). I enjoy learning about interesting and cutting-edge technologies and building out fun projects with them. Oh, and I cannot forget to mention that this hiring season, I am busy seeking out full-time SWE opportunities for 2022!\\nSo far for my side projects, I have tampered the most with fullstack JavaScript, but I am always looking to broaden my horizons and try out new tools in SWE. For instance, currently, I am working on a Discord chatbot for my Twitch channel, written entirely in Python. Other languages and technologies that I plan on getting exposed to include: Docker, automation, computer vision, fintech, blockchain, data science, Golang, and Arduino - just to name a few.\\nStarting January 2021, I began occasionally live streaming my side proejcts on Twitch, hoping to show viewers cool programs that I can code nowadays! In between my studies and side projects, I enjoy lifting weights (mainly powerlifting), spending time with friends, and hiking! For the last 2 years, I have been active on Strava, logging in over 300 miles in hikes, runs, and workouts with friends, a trend I hope to continue throughout my futureüèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇ‚Äç!"
